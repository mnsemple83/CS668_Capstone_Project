<h1>CS 668 Capstone Project - Spotify Analysis: Grouping songs to build custom playlists</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a project that I completed as part of the Online Master's in Data Science program at Pace University. My goal for this project was to provide a solution for improving Spotify's ability to build custom playlists for its users based on the metadata collected from its extensive library of songs. I chose this project because of my interest in music and to gain some experience in using data science to solve a real-world problem.</p>
<p>Throughout this project, I applied several skills that I learned throughout my time in the program, from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to model building and evaluatation. I also developed some soft skills, including being able to explain my reasoning for choosing a particular algorithm and explaining the results generated by that algorithm.</p>

<div id="abstract"><h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Spotify is one of the most popular online platforms for streaming music. Based on the music streamed by its listeners, it can create custom playlists with a theme. Therefore, Spotify needs to be able to analyze the metadata collected from the songs in its library to build these playlists. In this study, K-clustering algorithms will be used to cluster songs based on their shared data qualities. Then, a Logistic Regression model will learn from these clusters to add new songs to these playlists. This methodology will contribute to a better experience for Spotify's users.</p>

<div id="question">
<h2>Research Question</h2>
<p>How does Spotify use song data to build custom playlists for its users?</p>

  <h2>Related Work</h2>
  <p>Many studies have applied several clustering algorithms to group songs based on their feature data <b>[3,4,5,6,8]</b>; Techniques for feature extraction include (XGBoost) <b>[1]</b>, digital signal processing and autoencoding <b>[2]</b>, and Pitch Class Profile (PCP) <b>[6]</b>; <b>[3,5]</b> used the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index metrics to evaluate the performance of clustering algorithms; <b>[6]</b> used Histogram clustering to measure accuracy; <b>[3]</b> applied t-SNE and PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset; K-Means <b>[3,5]</b>, or K-Means++ <b>[6]</b>, performed the best when it came to building clusters of songs that share similar characteristics; <b>[4]</b> used the clusters to decide the best playlist to access based on the user's emotional state and the music that they were listening to.</p>

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Songs in the original dataset cover 114 musical genres and 1000 songs for each genre.</li>
  <li>10% of the original dataset sampled (100 songs per genre).</li>
  <li>11 duplicates detected and removed.</li>
  <li>1 observation contained missing values (also removed).</li>
  <li>2,094 outliers were detected, but they were kept since they were the result of natural variations in the musical features and not erroneous data.</li>
  <li>Majority of the songs do not contain explicit content.</li>
  <li>High number rof songs with a poularity score of zero, but they do not make up the majority.</li>
  <li>Most songs are performed in a major key.</li>
  <li>Key correlations include:
    <ul>
      <li>Energy and loudness (strong positive).</li>
      <li>Energy and acousticness (strong negative).</li>
      <li>Acousticness and loudness (strong negative).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="method">
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Extract musical features from the dataset, as well as select non-musical features (popularity, duration, and explicit).</li>
  <li>Apply dimensionality techniques (t-SNE and PCA) to the dataset.</li>
  <li>Use clustering algorithms to group songs: K-Means, K-Means++, and Mini Batch K-Means.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the quality of the clusters for each algorithm to determine which one performed the best.</li>
  <li>Use a Logistic Regression model to cluster new songs based on the already established clusters.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="results">
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Each of the algorithms performed the best with the t-SNE dataset, and the K-means algorithm had the overall best performance. This is visualized by the following chart that measures the average silhouette scores:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="https://github.com/mnsemple83/CS668_Capstone_Project/blob/main/k-means_silhouette_scores_graph.png" width='70%' /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Using the K-Means algorithm, clusters were formed using a range of k values where k represents the number of clusters to be formed from the data. According to the silhouette plits and cluster diagrams, k values of 3 and 4 provided the best clusters.</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="https://github.com/mnsemple83/CS668_Capstone_Project/blob/main/k-means_results_value_3.png" width='80%' /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="https://github.com/mnsemple83/CS668_Capstone_Project/blob/main/k-means_results_value_4.png" width='80%' /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>With each song assigned to a cluster, the datasets for each k value were fitted to the Logistic Regression model for training and testing. The testing set represents the new songs to be added. The results of the Logistic Regression model were evaluated using a Confusion Matrix.</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="https://github.com/mnsemple83/CS668_Capstone_Project/blob/main/confusion_matrix_k_3.png" width='70%' /></td>
      <td><img src="https://github.com/mnsemple83/CS668_Capstone_Project/blob/main/confusion_matrix_k_4.png" width='70%' /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Based on the overall F1 score, the Logistic Regression model performed best with the K = 3 dataset. The performance score is a measure of the model's ability to determine the best playlist for newer songs, which is helpful when making recommendations.</p>

<div id="conclusion">
  <h2>Conclusion & Future Work</h2>
  <p>K-clustering algorithms have provided a method for Spotify (and any other streaming services) to build custom playlists based on the metadata collected from the songs in its library. It is also possible to add songs to these playlists using a Logistic Regression model that is capable of identifying the best playlist for these songs. However, the performance scores of these models do indicate that there is room for improvement. The quality of these clusters could have been improved if a larger subset of data were used. Also, experimentation was limited by system resources. A more powerful system could have allowed for more extensive tuning of model parameters. Finally, the difficulty of identifying the best clusters could have been influenced by the outliers of the dataset, which were actually natural variations of the songs, and not the result of erroneous data. All this can be considered for future exploration on this subject.</p>
